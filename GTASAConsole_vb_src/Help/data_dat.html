<b><font face="Arial">GTASAData.dat</font></b><p><font face="Arial">Edit at your own risk. Consists of Car Data and Color Data for GTASA Control Center. If you delete 
this file, it will be regenerated by the next time you run GTASA_Center. This file has three sections:

</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Section: DATVersion </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is the version of the GTASAData.dat, implemented to enable regenerating this file during version changes
Current version is 2.0.0, and thereby has only one line of information with the value of '200'

</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Section: GTASACars </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Seperator is ',' (comma) for main list, and ';' for Modification part. White-space and tabs are allowed. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This list must have all CarID's complete. The control center reads the CarID from game memory, and compares with this list to get additional information on the vehicle. Please edit carefully. This is also used as GTASA Control Center Vehicle Detail Table for Parking in Garages. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Non-drivable vehicles (as AirTrain) and boats should not be parked at all (edit at your own risk). Planes are not parkable at some garages (due to size of parkable area in the garage). 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Type 'truck' means that the vehicle is parked 1/3 outside of the garage so that you can enter in (used only for small garages otherwise handled as car). Please do not edit the ID of the cars. The Vehicle ID is the only reference to the vehicles.ide of GTA San Andreas. Type is used by the control center to decide several aspects of the vehicle dynamics, for example on prevent wheel damage, or teleport. Please do not change the vehicle type, as it goes hand in hand with the CarID. Car Name is free-text, and alters the name that is shown in the vehicle selection combo of the garage editor. The X/Y/Z dimensions are for calculating the parking coordinates of the vehicles in the garages. These values are mostly taken from GTA3 and GTAVC handling.dat files for similar vehicles. hHandling is the hexadecimal handling flags from gta sa handling.dat. This is needed to park a given vehicle into a garage with all normal handling capabilities (ie monster truck with rear-wheel handling). isParkable is the flag to prevent this vehicle from appearing from garage editor vehicle selection list. Some vehicles are not parkable (ie. trains), and gta sa crashes if you force-park them in a garage. Minor Color and Major Colors are pre-selection colors for each vehicle when parking in a garage for the first time. Please check the GTASAColors section for details. Allowed Modifications are coded in HEX, and separated with ';'. There are 4 different type of modifications. The Standard mods apply to standard moddable cars. The Generic Mods are Nitro, Bas Boost and Hydraulics. Wheels Mods are for changing the wheels.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There are also Mods that are assigned to a specific CarID. These can only be used with this CarID, as they have a hard coded DFF object reference to the given car within GTA SA. Please see the <a href="modlist.html">Complete List of Modifications</a> for details.
